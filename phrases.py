    You have three options today.

    You can conclude an agreement with foreign partners
    and promise the development of democracy in the country.
    Then you will be helped to create your new party
    and join the consolidated opposition.

    The second case is when you take money from both
    the oligarch and foreign partners at the same time,
    but they do not know about each other.
    Then you make your own political party to go your own way.

    Thirdly. Circumstances are such that you will be able to agree
    with only one of the oligarchs to create a new political party.
    Do you promise to service me at least 5 years
    and lobby his interests in parliament.
