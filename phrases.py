    The second case is when you take money from both

    intimidation of members of election commissions and other attributes
    of uncommitted elections are possible.
    You are considering several concepts of action, briefly:

    [1] To be honest, to speak only the truth,
    not to enter any dubious alliances with competitors,
    to play cleanly.

    [2] To distribute unrealistic promises to voters,
    such as halving taxes, raising the minimum wage 5 times,
    cutting utility tariffs 3 times, creating 2 million new jobs
    in the first year, building 30,000 kilometers of roads,
    50 modern hospitals , eradicate corruption, and so on.
    You do not resort to the black PR of competitors
    and do not conclude deals with them.

    [3] You understand that the chances of going into
    the second round and losing more than winning,
    therefore accept the offer of the incumbent president
    to become a technical candidate to draw votes from the opposition,
    and not to go to the second round, but to recognize his victory
    in exchange for the post of prime minister .

    [4] We must fight with any available methods,
    all means are good for achieving a noble goal!
    History will justify us. Such trifles as small falsifications
    of vote counting, and this is not a black PR,
    but just tell the truth with a slight exaggeration,
    so that the voters remember it better.
